Problem 1 Loading Data

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

To that end, write a short description of the dataset, noting the size
and structure of the data, describing some key variables, and giving
illstrative examples of observations

``` r
ggplot(instacart, aes(days_since_prior_order)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(title = "Histogram of days since prior order",
       x = "Number of days since prior order",
       y = "Frequency")
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

![](p8105_hw3_lef2147_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
instacart %>% filter(days_since_prior_order < 30) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(days_since_prior_order)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(title = "Histogram of days 1 to 29 since prior order",
       x = "Number of days since prior order",
       y = "Frequency")
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

![](p8105_hw3_lef2147_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-2.png)<!-- -->

``` r
instacart %>% count(days_since_prior_order == 30)
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 2
    ##   `days_since_prior_order == 30`      n
    ##   <lgl>                           <int>
    ## 1 FALSE                          977352
    ## 2 TRUE                           407265

There are 15 variables in the instacart dataset, and 1384617
observations. There are 4 character variables, and 11 integer variables.
Investigating the variable days\_since\_prior\_order, based on the
histogram we can see that it is right skewed, with a high proportion of
values at 30 days. Removing the observations that = “30”, we can see
that there are several peaks across the variable. The peaks are at 7,
14, 21 and 28 days, with the highest peak at 7 days. This may suggest
that people generally reorder from instacart on the same day of the week
that they made their previous order. The high proportion of observations
categorized as 30 suggests that anyone who orders past 30 days gets
grouped into “30” in this dataset.

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?

``` r
instacart %>% group_by(aisle_id) %>% 
  summarise(n_obs = n(), n_unique = n_distinct(aisle_id)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_obs))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 3
    ##    aisle_id  n_obs n_unique
    ##       <int>  <int>    <int>
    ##  1       83 150609        1
    ##  2       24 150473        1
    ##  3      123  78493        1
    ##  4      120  55240        1
    ##  5       21  41699        1
    ##  6      115  36617        1
    ##  7       84  32644        1
    ##  8      107  31269        1
    ##  9       91  26240        1
    ## 10      112  23635        1
    ## # … with 124 more rows

Aisle 83 has the most orders, and there are 134 aisles in total.

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10,000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>% group_by(aisle_id) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  subset(n > 10000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(aisle_id, n, label = aisle_id)) + 
  geom_point() + labs(
    title = "Number of Items ordered by Aisle",
    x = "Aisle Number",
    y = "Number of Items Ordered"
  ) + scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140)
  ) + scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = c(20000, 40000, 60000, 80000, 100000, 120000, 140000)
  )
```

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle == c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarise(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_obs)) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  top_n(3) %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% 
  select(-aisle) %>% 
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("Product Name", "Number of items ordered"))
```

    ## Selecting by n_obs

    ## Warning: `as.tibble()` is deprecated, use `as_tibble()` (but mind the new semantics).

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table)

``` r
instacart %>% select(order_dow, order_hour_of_day, product_name) %>% 
  filter(product_name == c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(order_dow, order_hour_of_day, product_name) %>% 
  summarise(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  filter(n_obs == max(n_obs)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_hour = mean(n_obs)) %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  ) %>% knitr::kable(col.names = c("Product Name", "Sun", "Mon", "Tues", "Wed", "Thurs", "Fri", "Sat"))
```

    ## Warning in product_name == c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream"):
    ## longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
